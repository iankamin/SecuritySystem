# Security System (Team Clouseau)
This is an alarm system that alerts the surrounding area when an intruder through a passageway.

An inividual walks up to the numeric keybpad and enters the code to enter, each keypress vibrates the keypad. Once correct the code is entered a green indicator led lights and the individual is allowed to pass. If an incorrect or no code is entered the red led remains on. If the individual passes the doorway while in this state the buzzer pulses. The correct code has to then be entered to turn the buzzer off and put the system in the unlocked state.

Once unlocked, a new code can be entered to enter the locked state. This is now the new code that is needed to enter the unlocked state. In addition, the code is saved to EEPROM so that on restart or shutdown the pass code is retained.
